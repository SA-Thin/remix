Longworth, however,  in desperate need of money, killed the preacher with Hamlet's sword and  stole the  manuscript.  Longworth,  who  does  not  smoke,  planted the German-made cigarette near the  victim's body to throw  suspicion from  himself; but  in the  process, he  accidentally dropped his packet of aspirin.
